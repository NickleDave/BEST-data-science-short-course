# week 1 instructions.

Class will be based on the following Software Carpentry lessons:  
http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/  
http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/  

## Before class
1. Install git: https://git-scm.com/downloads


2. Set up a Github profile: https://github.com/

For this lesson we'll work from the command line, not from a GUI.
 If you don't have any idea what any of that means, don't worry about
  it, you will soon.
